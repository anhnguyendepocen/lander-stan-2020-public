# Lander Analytics Stan Class 2020

### Code 

* We will mostly be using the R markdown document `main.Rmd` 
* The data required in `main.Rmd` is in the `data` directory. 
* The Stan programs will go in the `stan_programs` directory. To start there are only a few (incomplete) programs. We'll be adding to this as we go.

### Slides

* Slides will be in the `slides` directory. More will be added as the class progresses.

### Links

* Interactive MCMC demo: https://chi-feng.github.io/mcmc-demo/app.html

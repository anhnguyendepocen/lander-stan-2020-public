# Lander Analytics Stan Class 2020

* We will mostly be using the R markdown document `main.Rmd` 
* The data required in `main.Rmd` is in the `data` directory. 
* The Stan programs will go in the `stan_programs` directory. To start there are only a few (incomplete) programs. We'll be adding to this as we go.
